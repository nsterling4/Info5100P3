Timestamp,Your NetID,One thing you like about this visualization:,One thing you think is in need of improvement in this visualization:,One suggestion you have for the visualization designers:
5/3/2019 11:22:05,eat84,I like how the marks and channels are visualized sequentially/smoothly,Not sure what the points represent,Consider a mouseover on the points to explain each mark
5/3/2019 11:25:47,mjb485,Cool animations!,Understanding exactly what diffusion means in relation to the dot topics,Larger dots!
5/3/2019 11:27:03,bfd27,great visualization showing great data points,could color the graph with a more user-friendly color,recolor the graph 
5/3/2019 11:27:11,hl566,"It's very visually pleasing, and the animations are perfect speed too",Explain what diffusion is,maybe have a color legend for the different categories 
5/3/2019 11:27:24,ntm27,The colors,The legend needs better spacing (scatterplot),Add more detail/explanation
5/3/2019 11:27:27,chc94,The fluidity in animation,Make it smaller so that it fits on a zoom of 100%,"When it comes down to it, the animation coded for this visualization does not bring any clarity or purpose."
5/3/2019 11:27:37,kav53,like the animation,maybe could make it a little bit slower,"make dots bigger
"
5/3/2019 11:27:46,ro99,cool transitions of labels & graph elements,constant movement is sort of difficult to understand,have a button to change certain variables with the same animation
5/3/2019 11:27:49,ras533,I like the animation and contrast of colors; it's very engaging and entertaining to watch. I like how the green plotted area grows and then the side bar moves.,"I think the whole animation needs to happen faster - I just kept scrolling expecting more things and didn't think there was anything in the visualization, and then the animation caught me by surprise. So the transition between the side bar moving and the diffusion bar appearing is a bit slow.",Maybe make the graph a bit smaller? I'm on full-screen for a 13-inch and can't completely see everything; right side gets cut off a teeny bit
5/3/2019 11:27:55,gar224,I think that the visualization moving is really cool,I think the numbers need to be bigger or there needs to be away to control the animation part so that people have enough time to take the data in,Maybe make the numbers bigger
5/3/2019 11:28:08,az428,Like the animations/transitions ,An intuitive legend for the data point colors,"Interactivity with the user rather than having the animation play on its own, so user can see visualizations at own pace"
5/3/2019 11:28:15,mdn53,really nice animation,users can't really interact with visualization,should make it interactacble rather than just animation. Maybe sliders or buttons
5/3/2019 11:28:18,ml944,Nice animations,More text to describe what's going on,Maybe add some hover interactions
5/3/2019 11:28:26,jls628,I really like the animation in providing context and understanding of the data! ,It's not clear that the categories are clickable. Maybe change the color a bit on mouseover? ,It may be helpful to add interactivity to the graph after the animation is done so that the user can hone in on details they find interesting. Things like mouseover on points can help a lot. 
5/3/2019 11:28:28,pjf75,I really liked your animations,Give the user's better prompts for how to interact with the graph,Add instructions of hints for interacting with the visualization
5/3/2019 11:28:30,jek342,i like the animations,clarify what a diffusion rate is?,maybe a little too complicated?
5/3/2019 11:28:33,rej77,"I like the nice line graph, it looks nice.","I really don't understand the movement of the axes. I also don't understand the relationship between the graph and the dots - what is the line graph about, income? It's confusing to have multiple axes along the y-axis.",I would make your axes more clear and explain more what's going on
5/3/2019 11:28:33,ac952,Good representation of data using scatter and area ,Too many labels for the axis,Make each interactive feature more salient
5/3/2019 11:28:35,ejs336,"I like the animations, it's really interesting and cool",Maybe allow the user to replay the animation with a button instead of having to reload the entire page?,Maybe change the mouseover text into buttons? Right now it's hard to even know that you can mouseover them to make things happen
5/3/2019 11:28:39,kc626,The animations helped make the visualization very visually appealing.,"It was a bit confusing to see both lines, dots, and curves all on the same graph.",I would have added a small piece of text next to the graph so that its easy for users to easily see what the graph is currently showing.
5/3/2019 11:28:45,cp573,The animations are really cool! It is clear what you are trying to get across.,"Interacting with the points on the graph could provide more information for the user. In general, I feel like it would be nice if the user interacted more with it.","Maybe the animations could happen on click or something that way I feel like ""I"" am interacting with it."
5/3/2019 11:28:49,cym8,I like how large teh chart is and how easy it is to read.,Make it clear that the labels on top can be clicked. ,Label each line -- difficult to understand which line under each overall category does.
5/3/2019 11:28:50,As2639,Wow! This looks really good and the interactivity is great,Nothing really! ,Add a description about your viz
5/3/2019 11:28:51,ns633,"I like the color scheme use a lot. It helps identify what the different things you are trying to visualize, and I like it a lot that I can see the differences. The animation is also really cool as well.","It was a little hard to figure out what was the correlation between the diffusion technologies, and the scatter points that were mapped.","Nothing really, the visualization was very helpful, just maybe a graph that could help show what each visualization meant with their sub-sector so that I could learn about it more. "
5/3/2019 11:28:51,ecl86,I like how the graph is filled in,Maybe a tooltip to see what goes into each category e.g. Household,Maybe color the axes 
5/3/2019 11:28:57,ls797,"I really like the animation! It catches my eye well, and makes me interested. Also, the timing is really well done. ",Reading the chart is a little confusing though. I would like to know what each line means. ,"I would suggest not using a green line on a green chart. Also, I would like to know what the green blob in the background is. "
5/3/2019 11:28:57,sg988,I like that the transition is very smooth; the line goes up slightly more than it needs to before settling to its correct position. I also like that there are multiple types of technology you can observe.,Add labels for the points.,Allow the user to see multiple technologies at once for comparison.
5/3/2019 11:28:58,jgs272,Iâ€™m a huge fan of how the argument is made bit by bit via the animations in the beginning,I do think the animations should occur a bit quicker,Maybe give the option to replay all/specific animations
5/3/2019 11:28:58,vb265,It is very interactive,may be the line charts need to be more straight,it looks great overall
5/3/2019 11:28:58,afb75,The animation and line chart underneath the data points is a very unique way of presenting this data.,Clarifying the key,Define diffusion - not super clear and make the key stand out more.
5/3/2019 11:28:59,pwr36,"I like the animations, they feel pretty smooth. Nice looking graph too.",I don't understand why the y axis labels have to swap sides,"The animations happen very slowly (as in, it takes a while for everything to happen so it's a bit weird)"
5/3/2019 11:28:59,ys457,Very nice animations and good labeling so its easily to see,Make labels bigger and animations slower because it is too fast to follow for new viewers,"Make the buttons (household, commmunication, etc) more apparent that it is a clickable property"
5/3/2019 11:29:00,kw496,like how it's very clear,lines converge so might want to figure out how to make it more clear,maybe add mouseovers for the lines!
5/3/2019 11:29:00,lkn28,Interactivity,Legend hues,Orange is very close to red making it difficult to easily distinguish 
5/3/2019 11:29:02,coe7,like that the graph comes up piece by piece,Lines are a little confusing and hard to follow,Maybe make the lines different colours or add some kind of indication as to what the lines are
5/3/2019 11:29:03,sc2579,really well styled graph,animated axis sliding in is kind of distracting,get rid of animated axis
5/3/2019 11:29:03,fmr32,love the slow interactions that builds up to the data visualization,make transitions slower so the user can understand what each graph shows,have users know that each category is clickable
5/3/2019 11:29:03,mp832,The topic is very interesting. I like transitions on the graphs as well. ,Maybe you could add words explaining the findings from the graphs and the different lines. ,Could you make the labels bigger?
5/3/2019 11:29:03,ne96,Animation is really smooth and looks professional. ,I can't tell that I can interact with the technologies. User needs to know that they can interact with the different types of technologies. ,Make the technology names look like buttons so people know they can press them. 
5/3/2019 11:29:04,ms2628,The animation when first opening the visualization is nice as well as the transitions.,Make the different categories more apparent in the legend as it is not obvious at first look because it is too small.,Mouseover for each individual line.
5/3/2019 11:29:04,sjr254,The ability to filter and show different categories,The relationship between income and diffusion is unclear,Make lines in the same category slightly different shades of the same color so it's easier to see what is what
5/3/2019 11:29:05,Ema82,The animation,We need a better explanation of the data,A lot of the animation is not necessary
5/3/2019 11:29:05,jb984,I like the interactivity between the different technologies,What is the diffusion rate/transportation and measure of median income have too similar colors,Add a text blurb explaining diffusion rate
5/3/2019 11:29:06,sn446,The visualization looks clean and the transitions look good.,Maybe allow for labels that allow the user to understand what each line means.,Make sure it's obvious that you can click on the Words in the Legend. Maybe add some pointer or something when you hover over the word.
5/3/2019 11:29:06,amf269,Immediate animations were very cool to see with an adequate amount of spacing between them. Really nice!,More interaction and explanation for each line on the graph (which I think was mentioned as being added later already!),"Perhaps change the cursor so it is a pointer on top of things you can click, and desaturate other text other than the one the user is selecting so the user knows it is actually selecting an option."
5/3/2019 11:29:07,xz673,contain a lot of information,Might make the line look more smooth,I feel like confused 
5/3/2019 11:29:09,lmc327,animations are cool,The color key on the top axis could be confused as another axis ,slower animation?
5/3/2019 11:29:09,zp82,The animation of two y axes are clearly showing the two parameters they try to present,The animation takes too long,Everytime the dataset is changed it is not necessary to replay the animation of axes
5/3/2019 11:29:10,ec592,Really interesting topic. I especially enjoy the animations and interactivity!,Not quite sure what diffusion means? Also did not expect the line charts to appear.,"Make the ""Household"", ""Communication"", ""Transportation"", etc. labels look more like buttons. Also explain the axes more clearly (especially the y-axis)."
5/3/2019 11:29:11,LL556,I liked the animation,"I think maybe if they have a paragraph or sentence explaining what each of the different visualizations are, it would be less confusing?",It was really good! But it was a lot of information!
5/3/2019 11:29:11,lm686,"As far as onboarding the user goes, this does a really good job! Maybe just make it a tad slower. ","Onboarding on the design works, but I think there needs to be more onboarding of the data. ",Make it clear that each category can be selected to view. 
5/3/2019 11:29:11,dl697,"The use of double y axes is sometimes confusing, but the animation makes it clear what each axis is showing.","When each of the tags for line graphs are selected, nothing changes about the labels so it may be difficult to tell that it is selected.",Maybe highlight each of the tags when selected so that the user knows what they are observing at any given time.
5/3/2019 11:29:11,yg99,"The animation/movement of the axis, and the entire popup feature make the visualization easy to understand and interpret",better to add what each lines are,add what each lines are
5/3/2019 11:29:12,cmc464,nice-looking animations although i'm not sure they actually improve the understanding or content of the visualization,"the top labels (household, communication, etc) might look better in a different location bc at first i was looking for data aligned immediately under each like a table or graph labels",more intuitive controls for each of the features
5/3/2019 11:29:13,aca79,Very visually pleasing! Interesting topic,"A bit confusing about what the different parts of the visualization mean, but I think that could be fixed easily with just a bit more description","I think it would be helpful to have more explanation about what everything means (what diffusion means, what it is measuring, etc.)"
5/3/2019 11:29:14,agd57,good coloring,which axis corresponds to which data? What's the point of the animation?,"make sure the axes directly apply to the correct data, it's unclear which axis applies to what data"
5/3/2019 11:29:14,smr276,Visualization is effective at showing a lot of information without being overwhelming,"While all this information is not visually overwhelming, it does seem to be lacking a little bit of context and explanation",Add some mouseover descriptions for diffusion in the different categories
5/3/2019 11:29:15,mr942,I like the interactivity of and the animation of the visualizations,What are the lines from point to point?,I wasn't aware that we can click on the options on the top of the chart
5/3/2019 11:29:15,tjc233,The animation that occurs when you first open the page and the graph gets created.,The visualization itself is very good and doesn't really need improvement.,Add some captions or descriptions so that people understand what they are looking at.
5/3/2019 11:29:18,sjm382,The animations were unexpected and quite interesting to see in terms of adding more information to the visual each time.,"At the same time, the animations are kind of quick, so it takes a bit of time to adjust to what exactly is going on in the visual.",Make clicking on different categories more intuitive. I didn't even realize we could do that!
5/3/2019 11:29:20,tb444,I really like how just one graph is so informative.,"The response time from when you click the categories on the top, to when the lines actually show up on the graph is a bit noticeable, so it might be useful to reduce that time and make the visualization more seamless.","When the y-axis moves in the beginning, it gives an impression that the y-axis would be moveable eventually, but it never is. So it is a bit misleading, and could be removed if you don't think it's crucial to your visualization!"
5/3/2019 11:29:20,akv26,This visualization looks so nice. I really like the transitions in the graph at the beginning. ,"There is a lot to look at on the graph, so it is a bit overwhelming.",I would suggest having small descriptions of some of the independent variables on mouseover.
5/3/2019 11:29:21,jjm492,The visualization seems very complex in that the datasets brought together really complement each other to make a sophisticated graph.,I think one thing that needs improvement is the legend at the top is not as obvious at first in that a user may not know that they should click on it to display more visualizations,Make it more obvious that the legend at the top is clickable
5/3/2019 11:29:21,emg225,I like the transitions as you enter the site,You addressed my concern during lecture- using a tooltip to define what technology is being used,Maybe signal to the user that they can click the different technologies to see their progression over time
5/3/2019 11:29:21,wh395,the animation at the beginning & the switching,speed up animation,have a button to show all 4 categories
5/3/2019 11:29:21,avg37,Great use of combining different graphs! Colors are clear as well,"I would add an explanation for what diffusion means, and a play button to start the visualization",Make it clear what it is doing
5/3/2019 11:29:21,rll249,the graph provides a lot of interesting interactive features that give information about technology in households,confusing how the median incomes correspond to diffusion percentages,maybe separate the different graphs if they do not relate directly to each other
5/3/2019 11:29:22,pse23,i like how the scale switch sides ,does the graph accomodate like inflation ,maybe a reset button 
5/3/2019 11:29:23,dal326,"I love the animation, very well done ",I think you should add some text explanation for what diffusion of tech means,Perhaps add some CSS styling to the webpage 
5/3/2019 11:29:24,tp294,The animations were very smooth and helped bring to attention the different features of the visualization,can't really tell that you can click on the household/communication/transportation/entertainment text,make the clickable text a button instead
5/3/2019 11:29:24,yy459,there are contrasts between graph and lines,color is a bit boring / not visually pleasing,choose more differing colors
5/3/2019 11:29:25,bh377,The interactivity is really cool. I like how the y-axis moves; I think it keeps the user identify that it is graphing multiple things. The user can see that the ,"It is not intuitive to click on the buttons on the top to show ""household"", ""communication"", ""transportation"", and ""entertainment"". ",I think it could be more responsive.
5/3/2019 11:29:25,cmw263,Liked how the visualization loads and the axis set up,Cant tell what the lines represent,Maybe add another visualization to tie things together
5/3/2019 11:29:27,xw528,Very informative,More way of data visualization ,Improvement in color
5/3/2019 11:29:27,bag88,Nice animations.,Kind of confused of what was going on without labels or mouse overs.,I'm unsure as to what the green part?
5/3/2019 11:29:27,ach238,Use of color,Lines on the graph are not very intuitive,Maybe add a line or paragraph explaining what the lines represent/different points represent.
5/3/2019 11:29:28,adv28,One thing I liked about this visualization is that the graph is very clear and the colors work well. ,One thing that needs improvement is that the legend could be made a bit more clear. ,One suggestion I have is to increase the text size for the legend or move it to another place to make it more clear.
5/3/2019 11:29:28,yc2532,clean and easy to see,the line in the graph is messy,try to make the graph looks nicer
5/3/2019 11:29:28,eyf7,nice animation,it's not obvious what exactly diffusion of x% means,labeling and adding key
5/3/2019 11:29:30,ijw23,The use of animation to show different visualizations of the data without making it seem crowded.,There was some way to tell which y axis is for what graph,Color code the axises and the label to differentiate them.
5/3/2019 11:29:31,ky356,i like the animations and colors. ,The keys are kind of hard to decipher what is going on. ,Try to make a clearer key. 
5/3/2019 11:29:32,yl2546,The animation is great,Maybe add text explanation about what the graph is about on the top,"The sliding of axis from left to right is cool but not sure what function it serves, it is gone before I could see the axis clearly"
5/3/2019 11:29:32,bc596,very interesting about phone lines,COuld use interactivity,Add some interactivity
5/3/2019 11:29:35,az287,Ability to view diffusion rates of each category individually.,"Even though the cursor changes when hovering over the categories, it's not the most obvious sign the labels are clickable. Maybe change the background a bit when hovering over so they're like buttons?",Text looked a little small so maybe increase the size a bit.
5/3/2019 11:29:35,mz558,a deep understanding about the technologies,too many lines that distract people's attention,more colors could be used for further improvement
5/3/2019 11:29:37,nw344,the animation,not clear what each dot represents,maybe label each dot so users know what they represent
5/3/2019 11:29:37,nr292,Excellent introduction animations! Really allowed the user to break down what the entire graph was doing into steps,Difficult to see the exact trend you want to show with the points.,Indicate with a line what you want to show with the multicolored points.
5/3/2019 11:29:38,alq8,The way the data materializes in the chart is very appealing. The animations are superb and the overall design feels informative and not cluttered,Better context about the data that is being shown; it would be great to known exactly what technologies are being diffused,None at this time
5/3/2019 11:29:44,siw25,I liked the moving axis,Everything is fine so far,"I seen too many graphs in this class, which there was something more (creative)"
5/3/2019 11:29:46,yh838,It provided may details into the data.,Some explanation of what the red lines are for.,Try prettier color haha
5/3/2019 11:29:46,ams794,Loved the axis transitions to show different elemental change.,"Transition of diffusion rates is very cool, but the end result image is a bit messy? ","Maybe show the transition of diffusion rate, but let the final image be the end destination of the points only?"
5/3/2019 11:29:48,ms3236,"I really like how the data is brought into the visualization. The animations are incredibly fluid. Moreover, when clicking on the specific categories, like communication or transportation, you see a very appropriate graphic displayed on top of the default.",The beginning may throw off the users because it takes some time for the visualization to manifest itself. Maybe it would be better if there was a start button to create the visualization.,"None, it looks amazing."
5/3/2019 11:29:51,vc265,"The animation was interesting, because it made me aware of the y-axis on the right side.",The size of the graph is a bit big right now (at least on my 13' Macbook Pro).,"Maybe shrink the size a little? But otherwise, I think it looks really polished."
5/3/2019 11:29:52,nmp53,The visualization is smooth and clean with well picked colors.,The colored category labels are hard to spot at first.,I would suggest showing the green data last in the animation so that it doesn't distract from the axis labels.
5/3/2019 11:29:53,KFL29,Creative animated use of axis,It looks good,NA
5/3/2019 11:29:54,ads286,"The initial animation is really cool, nice interactive elements",What is diffusion? It's not clear what the data is showing,"Try to focus on telling a story more clearly, not just presenting the data"
5/3/2019 11:29:56,xj88,The animation is smooth,"When click on the legends, the lines are overlapped sometimes. Not easy to track individual lines.",Separate the lines
5/3/2019 11:29:57,nf238,Transitions and animations are smooth,Usability,Make it clearer how the user can interact with the visualization
5/3/2019 11:29:58,vmt26,Brings together a lot of different pieces of information into one interesting visualization.,"A bit unclear what the interactive component(s) of the website are, maybe make the words you can select like ""header"", ""communication"", etc. bolder or underlined so they stand out more.",Provide some text context for the visualization on the website
5/3/2019 11:29:59,yy667,Like the animation ,The animation show up too slow,You may want to add some mouse listener event for users to control the show-up of the animation
5/3/2019 11:30:01,An456,I love the idea of doing income versus technology distribution,I think the text could be a bit bigger maybe,"Nothing really, looks good"
5/3/2019 11:30:03,mjc473,I like that this visualization conveys diffusion rates across different types of technologies.,"Perhaps one technology could be selected when the visualization loads. Otherwise, I have to click on one of them to be able to see any of the diffusion rates.","Other than the initial selected technology, this looks great!"
5/3/2019 11:30:06,mam758,I like the animations and the clickable categories.,Don't know what each of the actual technologies are. ,"Maybe make some of the animations slightly slower, so I can follow more easily whats changing. "
5/3/2019 11:30:07,RL447,"I like the animation at the beginning, it was very eye catching and I e joyed the shift of scale","You could slow down the animation a bit, or tell the user that they can click on different things at the top. ",Make the buttons more apparent as buttons because they add a lot to the graph and it is Very powerful to compare against the other data. 
5/3/2019 11:30:11,jc2922,"It's clear that as time goes on, diffusion of technology increases. I also like the colors used. ",It's a little confusing what the dots on the graph represent. ,Maybe make it more clear that you can click on the text at the top
5/3/2019 11:30:11,kj258,I liked how you really showed all the stuff on your dataset and how clear you convey what your dataset is.,"Upon first navigating to your page, I wasn't sure why your graph dropped (in response to median income dropping) and thought that it was my eye acting up or something. 

Additionally, I think your group should focus on ""the story"" a bit more; what conclusions can be made from the data that your visualization can show?",I would suggest making that first animation either wait a bit longer before starting or making the animation more distinct so that the user knows that the graph moving is not a trick of the eye.
5/3/2019 11:30:14,sm2344,Great idea to visualize how technologies have been adopted.,Make the buttons more visible. Make animations more fast. ,Add labels for each line in the graph.
5/3/2019 11:30:19,bx67,The area and the line works together,The dotted line is misleading,Make the meaning of the line clearly
5/3/2019 11:30:22,mi252,I like the color chosen for the area,I think you want to make the links clickable ,"the animation is too slow, I feel like I have to wait"
5/3/2019 11:30:23,bap93,Very clean and animations make it look sleek. The median income chart is also clear.,To be honest I have no idea what diffusion is. And I didn't understand the lines that come out from the dots when you press them.,Maybe include some clarification details to help explain the points I mentioned above.
5/3/2019 11:30:28,iz29,I like the background graph so that two different statistics can be compared and users can decide ,I think the clash of color of the green line and the green background is hard to see for some people. ,Your graph also uses some red (lines) green(background). I would consider using different colors. 
5/3/2019 11:30:29,jpk249,Nice transitions and easy to understand ,Add mouseovers to the data points,Should add a way for us to be able to to types of technology shown on the graph at the same time
5/3/2019 11:30:32,yc686,I like the interactive aspect of it where the scale animates and the transition into the dots and lines,i was confused by the animation because I wasn't sure what was gonna come up  if I moved my mouse. A description or legend of each part of the animation would be useful,increase spacing so I don't need to scroll to see the whole thing
5/3/2019 11:30:33,sam489,It shows clear trends,Its not clear to me what the trend lines mean (why there are multiple for each?) Also the initial zoom on my laptop was very zoomed in which made it hard to use ,"Speed up the initial animation, I didn't think it was possible to interact with it when I first saw it "
5/3/2019 11:30:33,tt397,The animations in the graph complement the understanding of the graph.,Nothing in particular.,Adding another graph will enhance the understanding of the topic: diffusion of technology in households. 
5/3/2019 11:30:39,xw272,The animation and line plot interaction are pretty cool.,The line interaction button need to be more clear that user can click on it.,line plots can have wider stroke to make it more clear.
5/3/2019 11:30:40,axl4,The animations are nice and make the transitions between different things smoother.,It's a little unclear what diffusion in technology means.,Make the mouse change to a pointer when you hover over the different categories to make it more clear that you should click them.
5/3/2019 11:30:43,jd952,Comprehensive,No..,Better color choice...?
5/3/2019 11:30:43,zz357,Used good Colors.,Should include more text information on the graph.,"Use wider stroke, make the legends larger"
5/3/2019 11:30:45,vqn2,The animations are aesthetically pleasing,Animation for interaction is a bit delayed and doesn't respond immediately to the user which can be confusing,Make it more obvious that the visualization is interactive
5/3/2019 11:30:56,yc939,animated,"I really like how it interact with data, but it might be little confusing at first glance. Defining what each line represents would be helpful",Overall good colors and design
5/3/2019 11:30:58,aeb295,I really like all of the interactivity elements and the animations.,I think the fonts and formatting could be improved.,"It looks really good on the big screen, but I have a tiny computer and I couldn't view the whole thing at once so maybe keep that in mind."
5/3/2019 11:31:04,msf239,I like the brief animation at the beginning. It makes it easy to understand each bit of the visual.,Perhaps it can be a little clearer that the buttons are clickable,"As mentioned above, Perhaps it can be a little clearer that the buttons are clickable"
5/3/2019 11:31:19,jt658,I really like the speed at which data appears on the screen. The visualization doesn't move too fast which is great because it's not overwhelming to the user. ,I think that it would be great in the font size of the median income was increased. It was a little had to see the tick values of the scale. ,I would move the location of the legend so that it's a little bit more noticeable. 
5/3/2019 11:31:29,jq77,bar chart for nutrition is sensible,the bright yellow background color is brutal,the shaded area of the circle is using the same color scale as the background color
5/3/2019 11:31:43,ds869,"The use of a time-lapse containing a line chart, scatter plot and shifting the y axis.  It's very convenient that both y axis work","Understanding the significance of the dots in the scatter plot. They are identified as different types of technologies, but that's as far as it will go. Also, it's unclear which y axis works with what (% diffusion for line plot or scatter?)",Textual clarification about the shifted y axis
5/3/2019 11:31:47,am2658,I enjoy that the display is unique - its not a graphical representation we have seen in class before.,"The color scheme could use some work for clarity (green on green, etc.) Also, define diffusion! Additionally, some of the lines cut off - perhaps to sparsity of data? Mention this. ",You can try to not hard code size - make it relative because on smaller screens (such as my 13 inch laptop) one has to scroll to see the entire graph. 
5/3/2019 11:31:47,qy33,Good visualization of using overlapping graphs ,Better interpretation and explanation of what the area under curve suggests,Faster transition in at the beginning for the whole graph to show up 
5/3/2019 11:31:49,jlw377,I like how it was comprehensive with the data and was able to show all the data.,It isn't clear what the interactive component is to this project. Maybe add more aspects in terms of that. ,Make it more clear as to what you are trying to establish.
5/3/2019 11:31:52,alr282,choice of different colors for types of technology,Kind of large - had to scroll sideways and down to see the whole graph,Add labels to each point on the graph to show what specific piece of technology it represents
5/3/2019 11:32:03,rwr238,I like the flow of your animation and overall presentation in the form of one chart. I think it's visually clear and certainly aesthetically pleasing. ,"I think triggering the secondary animation showing the lines for communication, entertainment, etc... is a little confusing. I couldn't exactly figure out where to click to trigger it at first, and if I hadn't seen it presented I wouldn't have realized those were clickable features.",I would make your clickable features really clear with some shadow or button like aspects perhaps. 
5/3/2019 11:32:04,mhl84,Presents a lot of data succinctly ,Stronger contrast between income fill and points,Maybe explain what technology diffusion is
5/3/2019 11:32:11,edj39,good animation,larger and separate section for the options (household comm transport entertainment) because rn it isn't clear that you can interact with it,larger font/labelling
5/3/2019 11:32:12,kyh24,"The animations are VERY well done, wow, I'm impressed. And the visualization organization is very professional-looking. I like that I can vew diffusion rates of each category individually ","text is small, why do the lines end at some point? ","it's not clear to the user if you should be clicking or mousing over the category titles to see the specific category lines, i was confused for a bit when i was playing around"
5/3/2019 11:32:14,mmr244,Incredible viz. Very eyecatching and interactive.,Improvements seemed to be well-described by presenters.,The labels for each line are evidently needed but mentioned.
5/3/2019 11:32:20,ijc22,Good use of color and interactivity with the use of a slider,They could have had another visualisation displaying different aspects,More use of color
5/3/2019 11:32:28,cx67,"I enjoy how the labels and data points appear one after another, so that the viewer can see how the visualization ends up/ultimately lays out without being given too much information at once.",There should be a clearer description of what exactly 'diffusion' is meant by. Points could also be made larger.,Certain text and points could be larger
5/3/2019 11:32:35,Fsr32,I this visualization is super cool and delivers information well. Its a way to display information I haven't seen presented yet and it is really pleasing to look at!,One thing is that the intentional lag when clicking stuff can be confusing. At first I wasn't sure if it was me causing the action or if it was just programmed in by you guys,"None, I really liked this just be more aware of user interaction"
5/3/2019 11:32:43,ao322,cool use of animation!,what is the point of the animation? its kind of a lot of happening at once so I have to wait for it to finish before i can actaully see what is going on in the visualization,maybe also include some context in the visualization to explain the background
5/3/2019 11:33:23,hk592,The page open transitions are a nice feature and make the large number of lines that eventually appear less imposing.,It isn't immediately evident that clicking on technology group labels will cause the graph to display additional information.,Maybe consider changing the labels to colored buttons so that it is more clear that clicking will cause an effect?
5/3/2019 11:36:57,xg256,The overall visualization is fascinating,The visualization will be better if the starting interactivity were not automatic.,Change automatic operation to user manual operation will be better
5/3/2019 11:37:07,zm255,Very intact visualization,more explanation of the graph,not really
5/3/2019 11:37:08,nbb42,"I like the subtle Key. It's not in your face, but its easy to understand the colored words correspond to the colored dots.",it didn't fit to my screen so i was moving around to see everything and didn't see the majority of dots appear (most are on the bottom),"Make the transitions a little faster, I thought that the animation was over before it was."
5/3/2019 11:37:31,sy623,One thing that I like about the visualization is the user interface of the visualization. The dynamic effects when we first open up the site makes it more interesting. ,"Although I do see the use case for  the double y-axis, it might be a bit confusing for many users as the units and incrementation are different. Also I think that ",I think the legend for the graph needs to be improved a bit. Also there needs to be a clarification on what the green fill means on the graph.
5/3/2019 11:37:32,sib35,"Good colors, Animation is good. ",The animation when I click on a specific category is too slow in my opinion,Style the axis numbers
5/3/2019 11:37:49,aec273,I thought that it was really cool and an interesting topic,Make it more obvious that the categories at the top are clickable,Would it be possible for you to make the visualization relative to screen size? I tried it on my own laptop and had to zoom out to be able to see the entire thing
5/3/2019 11:39:51,gh334,"good size, color scheme, and good use of labels to display different categories","need to indicate to user that the labels are clickable, lines that have no endpoints look weird (what does that data mean?)",need mouseover for points/lines in chart. axis animation is distracting
5/3/2019 11:42:40,ld443,"Nice visualization, I like the effects",I know that the delay is part of the effects but I think the slack should be reduced (if possible),Modify the delay
5/3/2019 11:42:46,id96,"the transitions are interesting for the user, information gradually appears on the screen","explain what diffusion actually means, what are its implications, why is it important to make a vis about it",make the simple legend mouseover
5/3/2019 11:43:00,Js2928,The visual itself is fleshed out very well and gives a sense that it's essentially complete. The y axis for median income moving across before adding more data really helped me not get overwhelmed with information.,Just looking at the visual doesn't give me too much of an understanding of what the diffusion points mean. It might be helpful to give a little blurb about it above the visual.,The color coded key on top of the graph would look better if it was centered on the graph instead of what appears to be left justified.
5/3/2019 11:43:54,ky242,The animations and transitions were easy to see and understand.,Show the ability to click different technologies labels.,Provide mouseovers for data points.
5/3/2019 11:44:20,kl768,I like the animations and how one scale appears first before another with the circles- it makes it easier to understand.,There's quite a lot going on in one graph and the animations take awhile to load/wait through.,Perhaps make sub-graphs or minigraphs for the different technologies as there's a lot going on in one graph.
5/3/2019 11:45:26,jh976,I like the animation component of the visualization where it moves the axis to give a larger picture/where the graph is filled in,Maybe make the graph smaller so the x-axis is more visible initially,I think centering the labels would be a good idea and changing the something with the labels when selected would be a good idea as well
5/3/2019 11:45:58,al838,"This was a very nice data visualization, and I really liked the animation of the data. It really felt like a high quality implementation. ","The animations might be a tiny bit too slow. Initially, I wasn't sure when the animations were over.","The size was a little large on my screen, so I had to scroll around in order to see the entire visualization. "
5/3/2019 11:47:53,vlz2,"animations are nice, allows users to focus attention as things appear",needs more information,"as more graphs appear, add a text/ more information for the users"
5/3/2019 11:50:56,ah947,The animation is really well done.,Not entirely sure how much value the animation adds to the visualization.,Perhaps not animate every aspect of the chart.
5/3/2019 11:51:00,Lnf24,Very visually appealing design ,Message if your visualization isnâ€™t fully clear. ,Make the message of the visualization more clear.
5/3/2019 11:51:20,st775,i love the slow transition! it shows a lot of data without being overwhelming ,the dots donâ€™t seem to have a trend?,maybe add a description? the goal is not that clear 
5/3/2019 11:52:07,ms3236,"I really like how the data is brought into the visualization. The animations are incredibly fluid. Moreover, when clicking on the specific categories, like communication or transportation, you see a very appropriate graphic displayed on top of the default.",The beginning may throw off the users because it takes some time for the visualization to manifest itself. Maybe it would be better if there was a start button to create the visualization.,"None, it looks amazing."
5/3/2019 11:57:49,sb2355,the gradual animations are great,"When I select an option, can it be underlined/outlined to show what selection I made",Great used of space (dont need to change anything more)
5/3/2019 12:00:02,eb654,really cool animation stuff and meaningful data,add obvious indication of interaction or make the animations faster,make it hoverable or something
5/3/2019 12:01:47,spa42,The animation looks really cool for the way the data is displayed ,Maybe include more details about the description of the scales,Just a little more description is required 
5/3/2019 12:02:56,am2692,cool visualization with good interactivity ,"it is not clear what the user is supposed to click on, and does the median income of, say, $50,000 correspond to 30% of diffusion of technology, since they're on the same line?","maybe add an arrow that makes it obvious what should be clicked on, or make buttons"
5/3/2019 12:03:57,mmr244,Nice animations. Interesting data! (second survey entry lol just from actually interacting with demo),Different categories selectors have no feedback in terms of telling you you already selected it while the animation loads. until then it kind of leaves you thinking nothing happened when you pressed it.,Maybe add a colour change to categories when you press them or try to make animations faster or show as they load if right now they only render once completed? First suggestion is probably the actually feasible one lol
5/3/2019 12:06:29,igl3,"This visualization is amazing and so fun, the design makes me want to interact with. The colors and font are beautiful. ",It would be helpful for it to be adaptive to the screen size,I am confused as to what diffusion is
5/3/2019 12:07:06,zb43,The green area to show I come over the years is a good way to put a main feature in the background without losing any clarity,What the points represent ,Hovering over the categories shows their points on the chart
5/3/2019 12:07:10,yt376,"I liked the interactive portions, and the message was really clear through the trend shown.","It was difficult to differentiate points that were close together, and the color legend was not that clear.",The beginning animations were a little slow. I found myself waiting for a bit. Maybe make it quicker?
5/3/2019 12:08:31,jz626,"The coloring and font look really good, and this visualization is large and looks clean. ","I think the delay between the new information popping up (scales, etc.) is a bit too slow. ","I don't see any interactive parts, so that would be cool if added! "
5/3/2019 12:17:14,jl2578,I love how the interaction shows animation at the beginning.,It's somewhat unclear from first glance what the visualization is showing.,Make what's shown by the dots more obvious from a glance by possibly enacting mouseover or doing something other than a scatterplot.
5/3/2019 13:04:50,fj75,I really enjoy the interaction of this visualization. ,I like it as it is right now. I notice that I cannot go back to the scatter plot after selecting a specific category. Maybe it will be helpful if I can go back and see the relationship between each category. ,"I really like it as it is right now, can't think of suggestions other than making the text size consistent, ex: the two y axis. "
5/3/2019 13:10:21,mw749,The animation looks really good and axes are clearly labeled.,I think it's a little unclear right now that the different categories are clickable-- I just moving them somewhere else or making them bigger as well as some sort of indication that you can interact with them.,I'm a little confused as to why some of the diffusion lines just cut off after a certain point. Is this because there's not enough data or that it doesn't really change afterwards?
5/3/2019 13:25:35,ztb5,The animations are smooth and the visualization looks polished.,The timing of the switch between graphs is a little confusing and not entirely sure how it works. ,"I would probably make it more clear that the items at the top are buttons, not just text."
5/3/2019 13:27:01,zz643,animation of the chart.,There's a delay when I click on different categories to show the lines on chart.,"It would be better to adjust the size of the chart. I have a laptop with smaller screen, it would be better to make the size of the chart adjustable by the screen size."
5/3/2019 13:35:24,yz927,"The visualization looks very cool, which clearly shows the diffusion in different fields.",It would be nice if users can hover over a data point and see the specific content. Now the overall content seems a little scattered.,You could shrink it a little bit. Now the width of the website exceeds the normal browser width.
